# holbertonschool-headphones
In this project, we implemented a web page from scratch, using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously. The final result must looks the same as the given designer file.

This project was completed in 1 week, during Full-Stack Specialisation at Holberton School.

## Design

Design file can be found on [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company) or as a file in the `design/` folder.

- Float values can be rounded.
