# holbertonschool-headphones
In this project, we implemented a web page from scratch, using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously. The final result must looks the same as the given designer file.

This project was completed in 1 week, during Full-Stack Specialisation at Holberton School.

## Design

Design file can be found on [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company) or as a [file](design/Holberton%2BSchool%2B-%2BHeadphone%2Bcompany.fig) in the `design/` folder.
- If your computer doesnâ€™t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT).
- Float values can be rounded.

Here's the final expected result:
